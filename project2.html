							<p>    The purpose of the two maps are to show the directional distribution of mountain peaks in
Wyoming and the relation to landslide susceptibility. I also wanted to bring in a map to show
wolverine range relating to the distribution of mountain peaks and landslide susceptibility.
							<p> First I found my data sources on wolverines on USGS, specifically a shapefile with wolverine
preferred habitat. I started here because I recently thought I saw a wolverine den in Colorado,
and was curious to see if there was any tracking on wolverines. Next, I downloaded the
Wyoming Mountain peaks and Wyoming hazards shapefiles from the Wyoming State Geological
Survey. These data sources would allow me to see if there were any correlations between
elevation, landslides and the threat that may have on Wolverines.
							<p> After making a folder connection with all of this data in it, I checked the properties and noticed
I had to change the coordinate systems to NAD_1983_UTM_Zone13N. I then used the intersect
tool to make sure I was only using the wolverine data in Wyoming, and not the entire United
States. Next I calculated the Central Feature tool, Inputting Mountain Peaks and selecting
Elevation as my case field to see where the center of Wyoming's Mountains were. Next I used
the Directional Distribution (Standard Deviation Ellipse) tool to see if there was a directional
trend in Wyoming for the mountain peaks. The directional tool showed that the mountains are
mostly trending north west, and the central feature tool shows a similar trend.
							<p> Wolverines prefer high elevation, snow driven watersheds. As we continue with extreme
weather events, I fear that the wolverine habitat will continue to decrease due to climate factors
such as slow, or fast landslide events that push them into territory they cannot survive in.
