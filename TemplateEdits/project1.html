							<h1>Protected Area Designation</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/Map1.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>    For a Protected Area (PA) designation, apart of the curriculum for Conservation Biology, I implement a science-based solution in the Amazon Rainforest, South America, specifically the Amazon River and it’s tributaries. Even more specifically, the habitat in which the Endangered, Giant Otter inhabits. The main goals of this Protected Area Designation are to improve ecosystem stability, maintain a safe environment for the Giant Otter, and other species, increase connectivity from protected areas already in place, and stop development and deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest. 
							<p> The Amazon Rainforest is the largest tropical rainforest on Earth. Through inducing deforestation, hydropower dams and other egocentric regimes, we risk the destruction of a major climate regulator, the Amazon Rainforest (Müller, 2018). A science-based solution, such as this PA designation, will allow evidence on why this area needs protection and how it should be done. 
							<p>I am proposing to implement a Category 1b: Wilderness Area, for my Maximum Proposed Area in the Amazon Rainforest. Under the IUCN’s regulations, this area will “limit human habituation, exceptions for indigenous communities, protect long term ecological integrity, freedom from modern infrastructure, development and extraction, maintain ecological refuge and influence a quiet, simple way of travel” (IUCN). A Wilderness Area will enable the the Amazon river ecosystem to maintain its wildness, beauty, brilliance and more. Dispensing a mutualistic relationship between our material world and this ecosystem through clean air, water and wildness.
							<p>  I am in familiarity on just how much land I am proposing to protect. Under my knowledge of Sustainability practices, our world is going through erratic change due to over exploitation, deforestation, material goods and more. To improve our resiliency on Earth, protecting a biodiverse, productive ecosystem, like this, is necessary. Implementing a protected area this size can re assure the biosphere has a chance in fighting against climate change. 
								With that being said, I focused on the Giant Otter for a wake up call on society. This Species has undergone change and is bouncing back, but endangered because to human demand. The Giant river otter prefers habitat along banks in lakes, slow moving streams and rivers. I used this as a tool to include as much water as I could in my protected area, as well as habitat that surrounds it. This strategy is enabling protection and time for this ecosystem to recover. 

							<p> With Geographic Information Systems (GIS), I used a landcover layer to demonstrate the wildness of this area and the proffered habitat of the giant river otter (purple and pink on map below). This map includes layer of PA’s in place (pink), and Jau National Park (yellow). These PA’s are very fragmented, so I decided to connected them, increase size and decrease edges. Roads (black line) are to demonstrate how this area is underdeveloped, but risks development.
